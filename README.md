This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat help<b>
npx hardhat test<b>
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test<b>
npx hardhat node<b>
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js<b>
